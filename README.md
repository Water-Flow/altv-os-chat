# Description

Simple chat implementation for alt:V to get your server started with some player-to-player interaction.

## Installing Dependencies / Installation

**I cannot stress this enough. Ensure you have NodeJS 13+ or you will have problems.**

-   [NodeJS 13+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
-   An Existing or New Gamemode
-   General Scripting Knowledge

Afterwards, simply add the name of this resource to your `server.cfg` resource section.

`altv-os-chat`

Then simply clone this repository into your main server resources folder.

```
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/jovanivanovic/altv-os-chat
```

Ensure your `package.json` includes this property:

```json
"type": "module"
```

# Usage

There's couple of events to get you started with this resource:

```javascript
// Notice: these events are mainly serverside unless otherwise stated
```

---

## Initializing the chat

```javascript
// Notice: you should probably call this event on player connect or when the player logs in, it's up to you, but it needs to be called for it to work.
```

```javascript
alt.emit('chat:Init', player, [key]);
```

## Sending a message to player(s)

```javascript
alt.emit('chat:Message', recipient, message);
```

## Broadcasting a message to all players

```javascript
alt.emit('chat:Broadcast', message);
```

| Argument  | Description                                                                                                  |

## Working with player's messages

> This resource doesn't automatically append messages to the chat window. It is up to you how you want to manipulate the messages, to whom to send them or to parse them as commands.

```javascript
alt.on('chat:NewMessage', (player, message) => {
    // Do your thing here
});
```
